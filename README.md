I am brand new to learning code. I am very interested in learning how to do anything on my smart phone and laptop. I don't even know where to enter code. I have a note 5 phone AND I think someone has installed remote controls to my device from another device.  All my files are being uploaded to a cloud somewhere and I canopy access any of them.  I'm very frustrated.  Every file I try to open says I was denied access so I'm hoping I will learn how to fix this on Github. Any advice or education anyone can offer me would be much appreciated. # HELLO-WORLD
